# TO-DO
- Update README
- Test more and update "Insights" tab
- look into grad-cam and saliency maps for vgg
- undertstand and explan gram matrices better. update the home page

Visualizations
● Diffusion Randomized Input Sampling
Explanation (DF-RISE)
● Diffusion Gradient-Weighted Class
Activation Mapping (DF-CAM)
● Exponential Time-Step Sampling
● Relevance Score

DAAM Process

- Better streamlit slider progress bars. they should be updated or vanish!
- Style transfer/reconstruct is very slow. why
